    "- Measures radiation energy over spectrum of wavelengths. Converted to temperature through principles of blackbody radiation.\n",
    "- Emissivity is the ratio of the energy emitted by a particular surface to that emitted by a blackbody. Depends on the material, temperature, and wavelength. Generally low for shiny metals and high for dull materials. \n",
    "- Absorption = emission, so in theory: $\\varepsilon = 1 - R - T$. Transmission in IR is negligible for most materials. "

    "## Possible issues\n",
    "- Discovered that the emissivity of quartz varies significantly with temperature: from ~0.9 at 300 C to ~0.4 at 800 C. This could explain why the set temp and measured temp diverges at high temps. A potential solution is to coat the cap in black paint.\n",
    "- Tested the IR gun on a beaker with boiling water. It generally read ~90 C but varied depending on position on the beaker and the angle of incidence. E.g. 110-130 C when pointed toward the bottom of the beaker. Most likely, either different parts of the beaker are at different temps, or the IR reading is distorted by background noise.\n",
    "- Compared the IR gun with a termocouple in the furnace at medium temps (200-400 C). The IR gun consistently read 10-50 C low, while the thermocouple read 10-30 C high."
